## Insight and Recommendation

### Insights:
1. **Company Size Affects Pay**: Bigger companies tend to pay more than smaller ones. It's worth looking into why and if it's fair to everyone.

2. **Different Types of Work Get Different Pay**: Full-time workers get paid more than part-time or contract workers. Think about what benefits each type of worker gets to keep everyone happy and motivated. üòÑ

3. **Pay Changes Over Time**: Despite ups and downs, salaries generally went up from 2020 to 2022.üìà

4. **Where You Work Matters**: Pay can vary based on where the company is and where the employees live. üèöÔ∏è




### Recommendation
- **Focus on Senior Staff**: Because there are a lot of senior-level employees, it's smart to support them with training and growth opportunities to keep their skills and leadership valuable.

- **Fix Pay Differences by Job Title**: Even though Principal Data Scientists earn the most, there's a big gap between what executives and entry-level workers make. Look into adjusting pay to make sure it's fair and attracts and keeps good workers at all levels.
